\chapter{Foundations and Related Work}

Here, introduce necessary foundations that is required for understanding your thesis proposal. For example, your research area is on Chaos engineering, and it is necessary for readers to know the concept of chaos experiment.

In addition to discussing about foundations, you need to discuss about why the problem you are tackling has been insufficiently solved before. To do so, you need to mention related work and discuss what is the difference between your work and those related works.

You need to differentiate between Foundation and related work. Foundation is a method/concept/discipline.. that you are re-using and to understand your thesis proposal, readers need to know about them. However, related work shows why this problem has not been sufficiently solved before.
